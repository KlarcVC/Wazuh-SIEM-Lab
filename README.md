## üîß Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Wazuh Server Setup (Ubuntu VM)
- Provisioned a clean Ubuntu 22.04 VM
- Installed Wazuh 4.12 with:
  ```bash
  curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.12/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
Accessed the Wazuh Web UI at https://<wazuh-vm-ip>:443

Signed in successfully and verified all services running

2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying Linux Agent (Ubuntu VM #2)
Installed the Wazuh agent on a second Ubuntu VM:

wget https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/wazuh-agent_4.12.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i wazuh-agent_4.12.0-1_amd64.deb
Registered and connected it to the Wazuh server

Confirmed the agent is active in the Wazuh dashboard

Ran test commands (e.g., SSH attempts, file edits) ‚Äî entries successfully appeared in the dashboard

3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying Windows Agent (Windows Host)
Installed Wazuh agent using PowerShell:

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/windows/wazuh-agent-4.12.0-1.msi -OutFile wazuh-agent.msi
Start-Process .\wazuh-agent.msi
Registered the Windows agent with the Wazuh manager

Agent appeared as active in the dashboard

Installed a sample program on Windows ‚Äî logs appeared in Wazuh under Security Events

‚úÖ Outcomes
All three endpoints (Ubuntu agent, Windows host, Wazuh server) are online and communicating

Real-time logs and security events populate the Wazuh dashboard

Hands-on experience with agent deployment, event correlation, and threat visibility

üìå Next Steps
Simulate common attack vectors (brute force, malware)

Configure email alerting via SMTP

Add Suricata/Zeek for deeper network traffic analysis

Automate deployment with Ansible or Terraform
